# Work Day Scheduler

This work day scheduler application allows the user to type in what their schedule is for the day hour by hour. The application will keep track of what time it is currently by highlighting cells as green, red, and gray.

This application will allow you to save down your schedule to local storage, so that you can come back later to look at your schedule.
